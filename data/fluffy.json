	"overview": "In this Unity project, we have Fluffy the cat that tries to use its meowing skills and switches that control magnets and fans to lure dogs into cages. The levels require a bit of thinking before it can be cracked. The aim of this project was to create a fun physics based game as part of our Game Development class project. We were unable to find a good model for Fluffy and is funnily just a pink cube while the rest of the environment looks dashing!",
