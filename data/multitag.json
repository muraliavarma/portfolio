	"overview": "In this project, I used Unity Editor features to allow game objects to have multiple tags. In the default version of Unity, every object can have only a single tag. This is highly inconvenient when we have objects that share multiple properties since the only option is to create a new compound tag. Not surprisingly, this is one of the top feature requests in Unity.",
