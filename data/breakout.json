	"title": "Musical Breakout",
	"overview": "This was my first project in Unity as part of our Game Dev course in Georgia Tech. This game shows a few of the basic tricks that I learnt such as one hit audio clips, following objects, prefabs and many more. There are a few bugs where the ball bounces off weirdly. But everything is awesome when the bricks in game are musical notes and we have Hungarian Rhapsody playing in the background.",
