	"title": "Inner Circle Framework",
	"overview": "Inner Circle was a framework of tools developed in various languages and deployed in multiple servers, integrated into a single dashboard mainly for managerial tasks. I required a thorough knowledge of web security to ensure seamless integration of tools from different developers into the framework. One of the tools that I developed for Inner Circle was the 'Resource Planner' tool which needed me to extend the functionality of a Gantt Chart to allow overlapping tasks and thus represent more data in less space.",
