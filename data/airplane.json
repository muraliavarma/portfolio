	"overview": "Plastic Bogeys is a Flight Simulation game made in Unity set inside a home using toy airplanes. Players have the freedom to move as they see fit using conventional flight sim controls (pitch/yaw). They also have control over their speed and access to four weapons, namely - a pea shooter, a heat seaking missile, a vision blinder gun  and static electricity that temporarily inverts the enemies controls. Players can test their skills by competing against the ruthless AI or head to head over the internet.",
