	"title": "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics - Fluid Simulation",
	"overview": "This project demonstrates the use of WebGL (with Three.js) to simulate fluid motion. We implemeted it using particles as tiny spheres using a paper on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The framerate was really low, so the below video shows a small segment of the buffered result so that we can see the fluid motion clearly. Use the buffer option in Live Demo to see continuous fluid motion.",
