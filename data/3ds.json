	"overview": "This was a hobby project during my final year of undergraduate studies. To make this dorm room render look realistic, I used bump mapping for getting the faded walls and a complex tiling formula for the floor. I also modelled and textured the chair by extruding cubes. For the final render, I used the VRay plugin in 3D Studio Max.",
