	"title": "XNA Space Shooter Game",
	"overview": "This project was a simple project that involved a 2.5D space shooter game that involved BasicEffect, lighting, textures, loading models and drawing primitives. This helped me get a flavor of the power of XNA 4. I will be working on much more advanced projects in the future for XBOX development.",
