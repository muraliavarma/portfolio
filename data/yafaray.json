	"overview": "In this graduate project, I use the amazing Yafaray renderer to create photo realistic images. It mainly highlights 3 features: Volumetrics - which gives the foggy effect, Depth of Field - which gives the blur effect on some of the wine glasses and caustics - which concentrates refracted light to form red patters on the ground.",
