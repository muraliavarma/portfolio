	"overview": "This was my undergrad summer internship project at TCS (Tata Consultancy Services). I independently developed a highly customized automated file backup tool in Java swings. With the ability to periodically backup a collection of folders in an easy to use tabbed interface, the tool was very customizable and was thus widely used in TCS. I also added an event scheduler to the software to prompt meeting reminders as I had completed the file backup segment well ahead of time.",
